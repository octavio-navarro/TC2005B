# Front-end development

Front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves creating the user-facing part of a website or web application. It focuses on designing and implementing the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with in their web browsers.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to structure the content of a web page. It provides a set of tags that define the structure and semantics of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML acts as the foundation for organizing and presenting the information on a web page.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of a document written in HTML. It allows you to control the appearance of elements on a web page, including colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and more. CSS enables you to create visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple pages.

JavaScript is a powerful programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. With JavaScript, you can manipulate HTML elements, handle user interactions, perform calculations, make API requests, and much more. It enables you to create interactive features like form validation, animations, and real-time updates without requiring a page reload.

Front-end developers use these three technologies together to create engaging and user-friendly web experiences. They work closely with designers to implement the visual design and ensure that the website or application is responsive, accessible, and optimized for different devices and browsers.
