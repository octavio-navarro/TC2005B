# Web development code material

The material will be separated in the following sections:

- [Front](Front/Readme.md): Front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves creating the user-facing part of a website or web application. It focuses on designing and implementing the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with in their web browsers.

- [Back](Back/Readme.md): Backend development refers to the server-side of web development. It's responsible for managing the logic, data storage, and server configuration of a web application. Backend development primarily focuses on how the website works, updating and processing data, and ensuring everything on the client-side (front-end) actually works.
