# Back-end development

Backend development refers to the server-side of web development. It's responsible for managing the logic, data storage, and server configuration of a web application. Backend development primarily focuses on how the website works, updating and processing data, and ensuring everything on the client-side (front-end) actually works.

Backend developers use server-side languages to build the business logic of a web application, such as user authentication, data validation, and routing. Some popular server-side languages include Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, and Node.js.

Backend development also involves working with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. This data is often returned to the user on the front-end. Common databases include SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

Backend developers also work with servers to deploy and manage applications. This can involve handling requests, managing security settings, and configuring the server for the application's needs.

In addition, backend developers often create APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow the front-end of the application to communicate with the backend. This can involve creating RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, or using other communication protocols.
